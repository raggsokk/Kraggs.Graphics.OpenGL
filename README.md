Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL
======================

# OpenGL (and OpenGL ES) Wrapper Libraries.

A collection of manually created wrapper libraries for OpenGL 4.5 core context and OpenGL ES 3.x.
This wrapper is also updated with the OpenGL 2015 ARB Extensions release, including ARB_ES3_2_compatibility.
The GL Function Pointers are loaded by code from the excellent [OpenTK Project](http://www.opentk.com).
Note this library is not for creating an OpenGL Context. Other excellent project exists for that. (OpenTK, SDL2, GLFW3)

## Usage:
1. Add a reference to Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.Core
2. Use your OpenTK, SDL2, GLFW3 to create an OpenGL Core profile, preferable 4.x
3. Add a using statement to your code.
	*Example:*
	
```csharp
using Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL;
```

4. Call instance function LoadEntryPoints() on the class containing the OpenGL Functions you need.
	*Example:*
	
```csharp	
new Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.GL().LoadEntryPoints();
new Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.DSA().LoadEntryPoints();
new Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.ARB().LoadEntryPoints();
```		
(Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL added to new statement for clarity...)

5. Start using code.
	*Example:*
	
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("OpenGL Vendor:   {0}", GL.GetString(StringName.Vendor));
Console.WriteLine("OpenGL Renderer: {0}", GL.GetString(StringName.Renderer));
Console.WriteLine("OpenGL Version:  {0}", GL.GetString(StringName.Version));
Console.WriteLine("GLSL Version:    {0}", GL.GetString(StringName.ShadingLanguageVersion));
```
	

**On my computer this takes about 3ms to load!**
	
		
## WARNING:
These projects have just been rewritten from scratch to use the new OpenTK Loader from the [OpenTK Project](http://www.opentk.com) v1.1.4.
Since the new loader from OpenTK rewrites the MSIL as a post build process, it made the old layout with code in multiple libraries problematic.
The new design have now merged all the OpenGL Projects to one and will merge the OpenGL ES to another (when its implemented).
In order to create smaller code deployments, use the same solution as OpenTK uses, which is to run the final executable through Monolinker to merge just the code you use into one assembly.

## The solution has these projects.

### Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.Core
This is the OpenGL library which implements the OpenGL Core v4.4 functions. It also contains ARB, DSA, NV and some AMD functions relevant to the core context.
A litte note from the OpenGL Wiki about Core ARB Extensions:
>Core Extensions
>OpenGL version 3.0 added a 4th general group of extension: core extensions. Their purpose is to expose core features from higher versions in lower versions, which is particularly useful if those core features are hardware-based.
>Core extensions all have the GL_ARB prefix, but their functions and enumerations do not end with ARB. This way, they exactly mimic the way the core functions and enumerations look; this allows code written to use them to be updated to higher GL versions without modifications. The behavior of core extensions is exactly the same as the corresponding core functionality.

### Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.ES
This is the OpenGL ES library, implementing v3.x of spec.
As of now this is not rewritten from old loader yet and is depricated until it is.

### EntryPointGenerator
Scans thru the source code and generates the EntryPoint Arrays used by the OpenTK Loader V2.
This is a pre build step used by both Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL and Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGLES.
Uses Roslyn/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis for code parsing.
Needs this nuget packages to work:
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
Install-Package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis -Pre


### Generator.Rewrite
Cloned from OpenTK project. Modified to be more generic and suitable for my needs.
Mostly that is changed to use a Json config file specifing changes from OpenTK's usage. 
Also change functions to drag this config with itself. Probably could just made it a field on the Program.cs instead.
Is a post build step for rewriting the dllimports to actual code calling into function pointers.
Uses Mono Cecil for rewriting the MSIL.
This is heavy MSIL Magic from the OpenTK Project.

### Discontinued projects.
* Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.Core is renamed to Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL. 
* Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.ES is renamed to Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGLES.
* Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.Compatibility is for now depricated (was never finished).
* Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.DSA is merged into Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.
* Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.CoreExtended is also merged into Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.
* Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL.Enums is duplicated into both Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGL and Kraggs.Graphics.OpenGLES.

## License: 

The code for loading the OpenGL Function pointers is based/stolen from the excellent [OpenTK Project](http://www.opentk.com) by Stefanos Apostolopoulos and others.
Also the code for rewriting the DLL using Cecil is from the OpenTK Project. The licenses in all these cases are retained, but marked as modified.
Since a large portion of these projects depends on code from OpenTK Project, we are using the same license as the OpenTK Project.
