        Core Extensions
        
        OpenGL version 3.0 added a 4th general group of extension: core extensions. Their purpose is
        to expose core features from higher versions in lower versions, which is particularly useful 
        if those core features are hardware-based.

        Core extensions all have the GL_ARB prefix, but their functions and enumerations do not end 
        with ARB. This way, they exactly mimic the way the core functions and enumerations look; 
        this allows code written to use them to be updated to higher GL versions without modifications. 
        The behavior of core extensions is exactly the same as the corresponding core functionality.
