When glBeginQueryIndexed is executed, the query object's samples-passed counter is reset to 0. Subsequent rendering will increment the counter for every sample that passes the depth test. If the value of GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 0, then the samples-passed count is incremented by 1 for each fragment. If the value of GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 1, then the samples-passed count is incremented by the number of samples whose coverage bit is set. However, implementations, at their discression may instead increase the samples-passed count by the value of GL_SAMPLES if any sample in the fragment is covered. When glEndQueryIndexed is executed, the samples-passed counter is assigned to the query object's result value. This value can be queried by calling glGetQueryObject with pname GL_QUERY_RESULT. When target is GL_SAMPLES_PASSED, index must be zero.

Subsequent rendering will increment the counter once for every vertex that is emitted from the geometry shader to the stream given by index, or from the vertex shader if index is zero and no geometry shader is present. When glEndQueryIndexed is executed, the primitives-generated counter for stream index is assigned to the query object's result value. This value can be queried by calling glGetQueryObject with pname GL_QUERY_RESULT. When target is GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED, index must be less than the value of GL_MAX_VERTEX_STREAMS.

Subsequent rendering will increment the counter once for every vertex that is written into the bound transform feedback buffer(s) for stream index.
